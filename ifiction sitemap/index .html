The purpose of this site is to provide a web interface to a large number of
Interactive Fiction games.  In order to be useful to as many people as
possible, and to remain faithful to the minimal system requirements of IF,
the interface uses simple HTML instead of Java applets or other plugins.
As a result, the games can be played with any browser, even text-only, and
should work with text-to-speech and other unusual interfaces.
<p>
At the moment, the games are mainly just Z-machine 
(<a href="http://www.gnelson.demon.co.uk/inform" target="_blank">Inform</a>)
games.  As a result, the categories are not exhaustive lists of all the IF 
games available in each category.  But who knows what the future will hold.  
<p>
With hundreds of games on the site, there is no way we can playtest every
single one all the way through.  We also may make adjustments to the game
engine from time to time, and accidently cause problems with a game without
knowing it.  So if you happen to see any problems with any of the games
here, be sure to let us know about it.
<p>
Also, the descriptions are not all they could be.  If you are the author of
a game here and have a better description for your game, we'd love to get
your input. For that matter, if you were an organizer of one of the many 
competition categories and can write a description for that category that
better captures the spirit of the event while still fitting the
architecture of this site, send it in!
<p>
But above all... <b><i>Enjoy the games!</i></b>
<p>
Dave
<p>
<b>NOTE:  All games on this site are freely available on the Internet,
and may be present here without the knowledge or explicit consent of
the author.</b>
