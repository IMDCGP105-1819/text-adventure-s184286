This door from the <a href="index489b-2.html?cat=34">Foyer</a> leads into a long narrow hallway, 
with doors down each side.  Each door has a sheet of paper taped to it, covered with hastily-written instructions.  
As near as you can tell, these rooms are used by people who have little better to do with their time, so they throw
together quick little competitions based on silly off-the-wall topics.  There doesn't appear to be any judging taking 
place, so the only goal seems to be just to write a game that fits the topic.    </td>
