<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua"><FONT COLOR="#800000">Along The Coast</FONT></FONT></H3>
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1>
find myself walking along the rolling hills by a coast much as
I have done on numerous occasions in my youth. (I remember my grandmother
taking my hand as we walked the two or so miles along the downs for afternoon
excursions to town.)&nbsp; A well-worn path is all that I can follow.&nbsp;
Waist high grass sways to the rhythms of the strong breeze.&nbsp; After
an undisclosed amount of time (for time seems inconsequential), I arrive
at the crest of a hill.&nbsp; The view is magnificent.</FONT></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Churning
below is the North Atlantic surf which pounds the rocky beach -- as if
to remind each whom is master.&nbsp; Churning above are the ominous clouds
that warn that the November gales are coming. Halfway down the sharp slope
that makes its way to the ocean, a figure sits calmly beside a pond.&nbsp;
At this moment I realize that choice is not something I have control over.&nbsp;
The path leads down.&nbsp; I follow.</FONT></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>As I make
my way down, the figure turns, ever so slowly.&nbsp; A boy, no more than
ten, looks upon me.&nbsp; He is wearing a fisherman's sweater tucked within
hip weighters.&nbsp; A cap tries to hide, unsuccessfully, a healthy patch
of disheveled hair.&nbsp; Fingerless gloves warm his hands.&nbsp;
One hand clutches a fishing rod; the other a tackle box.</FONT></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>"You've
come," he says.</FONT></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>"Why
... yes ... I think so..." is my reply.</FONT></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>"I knew
you would," he says.</FONT></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Something
in the way he says this catches my attention.&nbsp; So calm, so soft is
his voice that it strikes odd.&nbsp; Amidst the swirling winds, the battering
surf, it is this voice that rises above all. How surreal the moment is.&nbsp;
I finally realize that I have no idea how I have come to be here, nor why
this journey has come to pass.</FONT></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>"What's
your name?" I ask after an awkward moment.</FONT></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>"Benjamin.&nbsp;
But everybody calls me Benny," he says.</FONT></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>"Hello Benny," I say.  We share an extended pause until finally I ask, "where are we?"</FONT></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>"On our
farm... my families.&nbsp; This is our pond.&nbsp;&nbsp; My brother and
I come here a lot to fish, at least we used to, until.... well you know."</FONT></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>I don't
know, but somehow I feel an answer is not long in coming.&nbsp; I decide
to press the issue.&nbsp; I offer a question. "What do I know, Benny?"</FONT></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Benny
ignores my question totally.&nbsp; "Can you read mister?" he says.</FONT></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>"Yes,"
is my terse reply.&nbsp; I feel upset with myself for being so short with
my answer.&nbsp; He has caught me off guard.&nbsp; Benny, however, is unaffected.</FONT></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>"Yeah,
I thought so," he says softly.&nbsp; And with that he shakes his head up
and down in a reassuring nod.</FONT></FONT></FONT>
