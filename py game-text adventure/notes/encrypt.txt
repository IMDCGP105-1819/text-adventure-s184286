[Note from the Author:

In our modern times, when games need interpreters and 256K RAM+, Encryptment
is a refreshing exception, allowing you to use the meanest of computers, such
as that 16K Spectrum you had mothballed. To do this, computer moderation had
to be discarded, a return to the medium's pen-and-paper roots. I recommend
printing this file in 80 columns, so given paper's variability of size, you
should first interact with this fiction by inserting lines so that it prints
nicely. It's self-marking, doing sections in order will be more rewarding (ie:
inscriptions, hatch, shrines) and, with the exception of L3's inscription,
knowledge of ANY game is unnecessary and may well hinder progress.

I wrote Encryptment in about 14 hours over 4 days, though it's been tuned far
too much since (I'm a tinker and a minimalist =). Not originally intended for
dino-comp entry, synchronosity being what it is, not only does the comp begin
at a suitable time, but Encryptment is all about dinosaurs...

Users of other interactive fiction systems may find this FAQ useful:

    Q: How do I save?
    A: Put your printout in a place where it won't be thrown out.

    Q: How do I restore?
    A: Remember where you left your printout. Retrieve it when you do.

    Q: How do I undo?
    A: Erase any pencilled notes that you've made. If you've used pen, erase
       VERY hard, or use whiteout.

    Q: How do I restart?
    A: Print out another copy of Encryptment

    Q: How do I play The Pawn, have a romantic interlude with the Cardinal,
       burn the boxes, etc.?
    A: Unlike lesser works, Encryptment's only bounds are those that you set,
       so edit this file and print it off! The adventurous may want a space
       opera, a mystery, or a cathartic piece. The interactivefictionous may
       want a cathartic space opera about a detective. I say "Go for it!"

Last May, I found a box an ex-flatmate left held Apple // games; a surprise,
for Apple //s were ten years dead, and he'd owned only Commodores until IBMs
finally met his Amiga's capabilities. Reading decaying manuals from battered
boxes, I discovered handwritten notes (see below) in "The Pawn". These bore
the letterhead of the Text Adventures Museum, which I'd read about years ago
(in Games Magazine?), but not visited. My curiousity piqued, when next in the
region I found that it was now the Church of Interactive Fiction. Its cardinal
told me that it was still the same place but tax breaks for religions were
better. The crypt was closed ("modern exhibits" were being installed in its
place) but examining the notes, he said that they were complete for the first
part, except that the hatch had another section to its inscription:
"K12 J5 J9/J1 J12 F13 G12/H5 H7 K10 M18 K6/B4/L3 B2 H17 F5/J7 I2 N12 C15."

"You can do it without that", he noted, "but you'd have a Snowball's chance".
I enquired about the remaining parts, and was told it was lucky that I'd come
when I did, for in another couple of weeks they too would be gone. I was led
into a warren of small rooms, which he called shrines of which the Shrine of
Summarised Summaries was first. It contained a number of Brass Plaques. These
read as follows:
  Zork 1: "N10 I14 E6/B3 D15 I16 I17 F15/B5 . A10 . A12"
  Zork 2: "E9 E16 E15 E14/C12 E10 F9 O10/I6 C7 E5 F8 I18 H3 G1 B7 A15 B15 A18"
  Zork 3: "C18 A6 H15 E17/K8, E7, C8 C10/D7 L5 E12 E11 F3 I4 I1 !"
  Deadline; Suspect; Witness:  "D9 G2 A4 N1 C16 C17 !"
  Sorcerors Get All the Girls 1, 2, & 3:  "A11 A3 A5 A17 G7 !"
  Zork Zero; Leather Goddesses of Phobos 2:  "' E2 C9 A7/ D13 G13 . '"
  Shogun, Seastalker, Plundered Hearts, Cutthroats:  "A9 H6 F1 L7 A2 K15 J13"

The Shrine of Wisdom's plaque read: "C13 A16/D5 H13 L10 H9 F7 F10 N17 A14 N8/
N9 C6 N3 L11/G3 M6/J10/_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _/D10 C4/I12 E13 C5/K1 L14 L13 F17/E1/
G4 N2 N7 E3 K16 C14 E4 K17 K18 ."

The Shrine of Cluefulness was hidden in a maze of twisty passages. "Take the 7
moves of the shortest route here from what remains", said the Cardinal, "and
you'll unlock the secret". The plaque read:
   "What hidden metaphysical meaning does the Crypt reveal?
    _ _ _ _ ,/_ _ _ _ _ ./_ _ _ _ _/_ _ _ _ !"

Have you any idea what it's all about?
