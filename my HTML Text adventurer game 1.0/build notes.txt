produce a "small adventure game" with 4 to 12 rooms, 4 to 8 things, 

game should not allow the player to die or become impossibly stuck.

include a readme that provides a full walkthrough of the game to demonstrate the "correct" solution.

notes :

what is the best way to represent the inventory of an adventurer or room .

how might you handle the commands? will you use a large if statement ? or other structure..

will things have long and short names for use with the commands?

how will you identiy rooms? by name? number?

make the investigation "data  driven", so it reads in text files (straight text, or some other format)
provide information such as room descriptions, directions and so on.
